            <p>The Education Annex is a new supplemental education facility located in Williston, VT, and serving Chittenden County's students grades 2-12.</p>
            <p>Our team is committed to creating a friendly, enthusiastic, and welcoming environment. We strive to build long-lasting relationships with our students so that we can get to know them as the whole learner. Of greatest importance, is that our students enjoy coming to our facility to work, learn, and grow with their teachers!</p>
            <p>Our educators hold certifications and skills in a wide variety of content and enrichment areas. This enables us to design a program that meets your child’s unique needs.</p>
            <p>All sessions are held on-premise in our new facility that features individual educational “suites”. Each suite provides an exclusive and distraction-free educational environment. Our convenient Williston location is located in a professional office park adjacent to Taft Corners and Interstate 89 for easy access. We have ample parking and curbside drop-off available.</p>
